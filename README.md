# scGeneCyclePval
scGeneCyclePval infers pseudotime from single-cell expression data and evaluates gene expression pattern significance. It uses Cyclum to model trajectories and permutation-based null models from shuffled matrices. Comparing observed and null distributions yields p-values, highlighting significantly dynamic genes.
